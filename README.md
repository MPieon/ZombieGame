# ZombieGame
Zombie Game for AI class (Group A)

Project must be clones to GameDev\_Projects in order for it to work properly.  Otherwise it will not be able to find Bengine.

Instructions for setting up variable paths for SDL, etc.

1) Go to System Settings

2) Navigate to Advanced Settings

3) Under Advanced, click on Environment Variables

4) Create a New System Variable named GAMEDEV

5) The variable value is whatever the path is for your GameDev folder (ie. C:\GameDev)

6) If VS is open, restart it. Things should now work.  If there are any issues, speak with me.
